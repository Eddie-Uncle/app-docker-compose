This is a Docker Compose file, which is a tool for defining and managing multi-container Docker applications. It uses YAML format to configure application's services, networks and volumes.

The `version: '3.8'` at the top of the file specifies the version of Docker Compose file format that is being used.

The `services:` section is where you define your app's services, which are the building blocks of any Docker application. Each service is an instance of a Docker image and they can communicate with each other and share data through defined networks and volumes.

In this file, there are three services defined: `mainline`, `stable`, and `alpine`. Each of these services is built from the same Dockerfile (`nginx.Dockerfile`), but with different build arguments and image names.

The `build:` section under each service is used to build a Docker image from a Dockerfile. The `context: .` line tells Docker to use the current directory as the build context. The `dockerfile: nginx.Dockerfile` line specifies the Dockerfile to use for building the image.

The `args:` section is used to define build-time variables. For the `mainline` and `stable` services, the `NGINX_VERSION` is set to the value of the `DEFAULT_NGINX_VERSION` environment variable, and the `BUILD_FILE` is set to `debian.conf`. For the `alpine` service, the `NGINX_VERSION` is set to `1.21.3` and the `BUILD_FILE` is set to `alpine.conf`.

The `image:` line under each service is used to specify a name and optionally a tag for the image. For example, the `mainline` service's image will be named `app:mainline`.

The `depends_on:` section under the `mainline` service specifies that this service depends on the `stable` service. This means that the `stable` service will be started before the `mainline` service.
